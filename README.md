Real YT Music, or RYTM for short, is a versatile YouTube application that seamlessly integrates YouTube's APIs to offer an enhanced music discovery and playback experience. With RYTM, you can discover, create playlists, and enjoy your favorite music videos like never before.


## Features

- **Background mode:** Background playback can't work on the lock screen due to YouTube's API policy, but you can just press the home button and keep scrolling with the video playing in the background
- **Playlists:** You can save your favourite videos in local playlists
- **Sleeping mode:** You can set a timer, fall asleep, and the app will automatically close when the timer ends
- **Bookmark:** In the settings, you can enable bookmarks for long videos

Avaiable on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ctrlvnt.rytm)
