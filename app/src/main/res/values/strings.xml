    <string name="how_to_use"><b>SOME INSTRUCTIONS</b>\n\n
        <i>SCREEN LOCK:</i> while playing a video, thanks to the central button, it is possible to block accidental touches to the screen by reducing the brightness to minimum to increase battery life.\n\n
        <i>PLAYBACK:</i> the function is available by pressing the home button on the phone, showing the currently playing content in the bubble. Music control is achieved by reopening the application.\n\n
        <i>DELETION:</i> deleting playlists or songs is done with a long click. NB: for history videos you must do this on the main screen and not on the player screen.\n\n
        <i>PLAYLISTS:</i> adding songs is possible thanks to the button at the top right of the video player.\n\n
